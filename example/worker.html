    <h1>Example of Simple Workers</h1>
    <p>If you open the console and reload the page you will see that the order of the execution of the workers isn't stable
       (the second worker may finish before the first one and vice versa)
    </p>
    <script>
      const firstWorker = new Worker('worker.js');
      const secondWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

      firstWorker.postMessage('first');
      secondWorker.postMessage('second');
    </script>
